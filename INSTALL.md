# Build and install instructions for coinc

## macOS and Linux

1. Make a build directory, e.g.

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build

2. In the build directory run

    $ cmake ../

3. Followed by

    $ make

4. And optionally

    $ make install

## Windows

On Windows it is perhaps preferable to use CMake GUI. Visit https://cmake.org/ for more info. Most compilers, e.g. MSVC should work.
